- slight memory leak on iterations -- find out where
- figure out how to have directional icon (little triange) on the path
- random launch points and orientations
- random start point of path and update the dynamic goal
- need to save generations
- consider co-evolve the random paths
- top level build script that builds debug/release
- benchmark the impact of debug mode code
- add general purpose logger
- at exit need a top/cancel close function in the GUI
- open up Z axes
- verify the simulator is working correctly
- verify the fitness function is working correctly
- change pitch roll throttle to be direct PPM MSEC to servos (500-1500)
