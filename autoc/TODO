- consider co-evolve the random paths
- top level build script that builds debug/release
- benchmark the impact of debug mode code
- llm fitness function evolution
- try to simplify the eval tree by passing a class reference instead of N args
* replay functions
  - select board
  - animate path, including tracking behind
- consider fitness function for distance, alignment is ramped sensitivity for first couple of seconds (to allow capture from random start)
- walk various classes for copy by reference, copy by pointer, copy by value == a smaller mem leak in autoc
- we can buffer the best run over a population vs re-running it -- save the final eval steps
- can not interactively flip to autoc input as it attempts to use the callback port -- soften this dependency for when it is manually run (maybe if port not set, it falls back to Mouse)
- plumb stdout/stderr nicely for a build run -- perhaps hook this into archiving system too
- figure out how to use crrcsim robots to form lead plane
* more accurate hb1 model
- Still getting thermal crash/corruption
- variations project - to get closer to zero-shot
  - vary wind, turbulence
  - maybe revisit thermal model
  - power, drag, service response times
  - get random start/orientation working in crrcsim
  - model and env dithering in crrcsim
- GP to autoc in inav via controls
  - selector
  - activate
- consider PID as basic controller (perhaps some other input/output to allow for slight tuning)
* clean shutdown method for terminating sims
  - now that a crrcsim batch runs long, perhaps have polling loop for keepalive as when autoc exits crrcsim will exit
- develop an offline fitness validator where a recorded path set and GP can be replayed, perhaps on a different path (e.g. old GP on different path set), etc
- blackbox rendering improvements:
  - we will need to select a path and a blackbox log to do comparisons
  - rendering and time offset should start when the xiao takes over -- it'll be a MSP flag set in the telemetry
  - user interface to allow selecting path, log file, etc -- similar to how the path/actual works
  - will need to have the blue diff lines between planned and actual rendered when comparing that model
  - need a flight model selector, a way to select one of a few paths to fly as the goal
  - might need additional attributes on renderer playback, e.g. loss of GPS signal, etc
  - animated playback -- maybe render the flight controls input and some parameters power, velocity
  - blackbox logs are 1/32 which is still a lot of data, can we do subselect, perhaps 5 hz?
  - probably need to export quaternion data to blackbox so that we don't get tumble effects
- also seems crrcsim is dependent on a valid DISPLAY even when in headless

Good Runs
- autoc-9223370305983481960-2024-11-06T05:34:53.847Z -- this is minisim large run on 25 paths
