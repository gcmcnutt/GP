- figure out how to have directional icon (little triange) on the path -- and or have the actual path be a strip of paper oriented correctly according to z axis
- consider co-evolve the random paths
- top level build script that builds debug/release
- benchmark the impact of debug mode code
- add general purpose logger
- at exit need a top/cancel close function in the GUI -- sometimes race condition on render thread right now
- turn white segment markers into arrows
- llm fitness function evolution
- try to simplify the eval tree by passing a class reference instead of N args
- need a way to dump progress for replays
- need to save generations
- recent changes may have a leak again!
- replay functions
  - select generation
  - select board
  - animate path, including tracking behind
- split rendering from GP -- basically a second program that can replay
- connect to crrcsim
- consider fitness function for distance, alignment is ramped sensitivity for first couple of seconds (to allow capture from random start)
- some memory leak is back...
- control smoothness is maybe more about craft rotation as a function of optimal -- not control inputs
- we have crash reason -- probably should record it
- walk various classes for copy by reference, copy by pointer, copy by value == a smaller mem leak in autoc
