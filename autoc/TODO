- slight memory leak on iterations -- find out where
- figure out how to have directional icon (little triange) on the path
- random launch points and orientations
- random start point of path and update the dynamic goal
- need to save generations
- consider co-evolve the random paths
- top level build script that builds debug/release
- benchmark the impact of debug mode code
- add general purpose logger
- at exit need a top/cancel close function in the GUI -- sometimes race condition on render thread right now
- verify the simulator is working correctly
- verify the fitness function is working correctly
- change to a cylinder bounds, not half sphere
- need to walk the path at a velocity -- so maybe another representation of the path
- turn white segment markers into arrows
- each generation needs a series of test paths
- llm fitness function evolution
