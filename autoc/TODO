- consider co-evolve the random paths
- top level build script that builds debug/release
- benchmark the impact of debug mode code
- llm fitness function evolution
  - this could be progressively raise the bar on complexity - staged evolution
  - co-evolution
- do we want to migrate to 100msec timing vs 200msec today?

- try to simplify the eval tree by passing a class reference instead of N args
* replay functions
- consider fitness function for distance, alignment is ramped sensitivity for first couple of seconds (to allow capture from random start)
- walk various classes for copy by reference, copy by pointer, copy by value == a smaller mem leak in autoc
- we can buffer the best run over a population vs re-running it -- save the final eval steps
- can not interactively flip to autoc input as it attempts to use the callback port -- soften this dependency for when it is manually run (maybe if port not set, it falls back to Mouse)
- plumb stdout/stderr nicely for a build run -- perhaps hook this into archiving system too
- figure out how to use crrcsim robots to form lead plane
- Still getting thermal crash/corruption
- variations project - to get closer to zero-shot
  - maybe revisit thermal model
  - power, drag, service response times
  - get random start/orientation working in crrcsim
  - model and env dithering in crrcsim
- GP to autoc in inav via controls
  - selector
  - activate
* clean shutdown method for terminating sims
  - now that a crrcsim batch runs long, perhaps have polling loop for keepalive as when autoc exits crrcsim will exit
- blackbox rendering improvements:
  - we will need to select a path and a blackbox log to do comparisons
  - user interface to allow selecting path, log file, etc -- similar to how the path/actual works
  - will need to have the blue diff lines between planned and actual rendered when comparing that model
  - need a flight model selector, a way to select one of a few paths to fly as the goal
  - might need additional attributes on renderer playback, e.g. loss of GPS signal, etc
  - blackbox logs are 1/32 which is still a lot of data, can we do subselect, perhaps 5 hz?
  - fpv mode for playback
- also seems crrcsim is dependent on a valid DISPLAY even when in headless
- need to refactor the opcode enum to only have one -- and then to stop using numeric opcodes in the bytecode2cpp generator

- check for dangling or vestiage source files

* bakeoff demetic migration should honor DemeticMigProbability instead of propagating every generation

* MIGRATE AWAY FROM BOOST SERIALIZATION
  - Boost serialization is NOT portable across different Boost versions
  - Current issue: Boost 1.74 (x86) cannot read archives from Boost 1.83 (ARM64)
  - Archive version in header changes between Boost releases (v18 vs v19)
  - This breaks cross-architecture artifact sharing via S3
  - Consider alternatives:
    * cereal (header-only, modern, portable)
    * JSON (human-readable, universally portable)
    * FlatBuffers (fast, efficient, cross-platform)
    * Custom text format (simplest, most control)
  - Migration required for: EvalData, EvalResults, Path, AircraftState, ScenarioMetadata
  - Benefits: version independence, better portability, potentially smaller/faster
